FADE IN:

EXT. STREET - DAY

A PANHANDLER stands at the corner of a traffic signal holding
a sign that reads: "Anything helps. God Bless." An unlatched
beat-up guitar case lies at his feet. Coins and dollar bills
meagerly occupy its cavity.

Cars whiz by on a green light. The light turns yellow, then
red. A slick convertible rolls up. Inside, a well-dressed
SUIT sips coffee while yapping into a smart phone.

                       SUIT
               (into phone)
           Yeah, babe. Six-four-two Sperling
           Court. See ya' in a few.

The suit hangs up, smirks, then:

                       SUIT (CONT'D)
               (under breath)
           Whoever said money can't buy
           happiness?

The suit turns, notices the panhandler whose weary eyes plead
for assistance.

                       SUIT (CONT'D)
           Can I help you?!

The panhandler just stands there -- blinking, breathing.

                       SUIT (CONT'D)
           Get a job! Fucking moocher.

The light turns green. The suit hurls his coffee at the
panhandler, then speeds off. The panhandler zeros in on the
license plate, which reads: "ABOVEYU". He wrings out his
soaked and tattered garments, then resumes business.

INT. HOUSE - LATER

Lavishly decorated. The suit nails a HOT CHICK. The doorbell
RINGS. He pauses - "what the fuck?" She digs her claws into
his back.

INT/EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The suit opens the door. Nobody there. He looks down, sees a
guitar case and a note. He furrows his brows, picks up the
note, reads it: "I hope this buys you some happiness." The
suit ponders for moment. His eyes widen at the revelation.

                                                   FADE OUT.
